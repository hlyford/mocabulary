Scripts:

- 'npm start' to start Node server (listens at localhost:8050)
- 'npm run python_service' to start the Flask server (listens at 0.0.0.0:5000)


Requirements:
- npm install -g nodemon
- Have Postgres running in the background prior to starting the app (getting postgres via Homebrew is probably easiest)
